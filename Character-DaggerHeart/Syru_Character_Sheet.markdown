## Background
- **Description**: Broad, stocky body with fine sand-colored scales suited for the Drylands; reinforced, weathered clothes; earth-like eyes; dedicated soldier attitude.
- **Backstory**: Syru, a Wanderborne Galapa, was raised in a nomadic clan roaming the Drylands, guarding sacred oases where Essentia glimmered, revered as the earth’s lifeblood. His sturdy shell and **Unwavering** resolve, honed by Elder Tormak, made him a protector, while his **Nomadic Pack** held tools from countless travels. A raid by Essentia-hungry warlords killed his sibling, Kael, leaving Syru haunted by failure, his **Iron Will** forged in guilt. The Colossus’s dream-rotting presence in MacGregor’s Haven twists his nightmares, echoing Kael’s death. Drawn to the town’s Essentia seam, Syru seeks to protect this new oasis and restore his clan’s honor. Joining mercenaries to slay the stone-cracking Colossus, he uses his shell’s **Retract** and **Iron Will** to shield his new “clan” (the party), his pack providing tools to survive the Drylands, and his unwavering heart driving him to uncover Essentia’s ties to Galapa myths.
- **Background Questions**:
  - *What fear am I helping you overcome?* Syru fears failing his allies, haunted by Kael’s death in a warlord raid. An ally helps him trust the party’s strength to face the Colossus.
  - *What did you do that made the people in your community wary of you?* Syru’s experiments with an Essentia-charged clan relic caused a tremor, spooking his clan and mirroring the Colossus’s quakes.
  - *What legendary place have you always wanted to visit, and why is it so special?* The Crystal Oasis, a mythical Galapa sanctuary of pure Essentia, could heal Syru’s clan and hold secrets to stop the Colossus.
- **Connections**:
  - To a party member: “Why do you trust me to protect you in MacGregor’s Haven, despite my failure to save my sibling from the warlords?”
  - To the group: “What have you heard about the Colossus, and why do you think it’s drawn to the Essentia in the Drylands?”
